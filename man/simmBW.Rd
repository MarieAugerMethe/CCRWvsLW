\description{Simulate a Brownian Walk (BW). This model represent the movement of an animal which has no directional persistence.}
\usage{
simmBW(n, l, a)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{one integer value for the sample size. Note that this sample size represent the number of final step lengths and turning angles wanted (when TAc = 0). The ltraj object returned will be longer because a minimum of 3 locations are required to calculate a relative turning angle}
  \item{l}{one numeric and positive value representing the lambda value for the exponential distribution of the step lengths}
  \item{a}{one numeric and positive value representing the minimum step length value}
}
\details{Maybe talk about Null model}
\value{SAY WHAT IT RETUNS (ltraj object!)}
